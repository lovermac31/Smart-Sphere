# OBJECTIVES

1. **Phase 1 – Materialization Backbone**

2. **Phase 2 – Persona & Skill Alignment**
   - Enrich each agent with ethics/learning/autonomy guidance.
   - Install the required skills/tools (coding, Notion, observability, vision) for every role.

3. **Phase 3 – Autonomy & Telemetry**
   - Wire routing + spawn policies so Orchestrator can coordinate the hive.
   - Give Watchtower full telemetry plus escalation hooks.

4. **Phase 4 – Continuous Governance**

   - Review promotion candidates for AGI-tier augmentation and deploy when ready.
