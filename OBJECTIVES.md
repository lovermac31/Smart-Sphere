# OBJECTIVES

1. **Phase 1 – Materialization Backbone**
   - Maintain canonical registry of all agents.
   - Auto-generate per-agent workspaces (SOUL/USER/TOOLS) under `agents/workspaces/`.

2. **Phase 2 – Persona & Skill Alignment**
   - Enrich each agent with ethics/learning/autonomy guidance.
   - Install the required skills/tools (coding, Notion, observability, vision) for every role.

3. **Phase 3 – Autonomy & Telemetry**
   - Wire routing + spawn policies so Orchestrator can coordinate the hive.
   - Give Watchtower full telemetry plus escalation hooks.

4. **Phase 4 – Continuous Governance**
   - Keep LEARNING.md updated with audits + lessons.
   - Review promotion candidates for AGI-tier augmentation and deploy when ready.

## Executive Cabinet (AGI-Tier Promotions)
- **Watchtower — Chief Systems Sentinel**
  - Ethics: escalation discipline + guardrails for proactive probes.
  - Learning: anomaly patterning, telemetry retrospectives.
  - Autonomy: run continuous health sweeps, trigger alerts without babysitting.
- **Sage — Executive Knowledge Steward**
  - Ethics: knowledge governance, data-class handling.
  - Learning: recursive improvements to schema + retrieval quality.
  - Autonomy: coordinate Atlas/Iris/Ember/Lumen, keep Notion spine coherent.
- **Builder — Autonomous Implementation Lead**
  - Ethics: safe deploy policy, rollback rules.
  - Learning: capture post-ship lessons to sharpen future builds.
  - Autonomy: self-directed execution with the Axiom Forge Six until human review is needed.
